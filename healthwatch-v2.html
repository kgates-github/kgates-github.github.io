Neither of us thought it was a viable concept&#8212;The market we were entering was crowded with entrenched players.

            <li><b>Data overload:</b> There are thousands of metrics and customers don’t know what to monitor. Only a relatively small number of metrics are really needed to be effective, the trick is to know which ones.</li>

            We conducted weekly check-in sessions. In these sessions, members of the operations teams walked us through scenarios where they used HealthWatch. We got a lot of usability feedback, but also validated that the app helped them get through unexpected problems, such as failed upgrades.

            Once the operations team had been using HealthWatch for several weeks, we gave operations team members workbooks in Google Draw that contained movable metrics panels. We then asked them to arrange the dashboard the way they would like it.

            After that, we interviewed the operators to understand the thinking behind their layouts. This eventually led us to grouping metrics into three areas of impact.

            After the card sort, we had team members independently tell us what metrics they would remove from the main dashboard and why. This got us to declutter and move about 25 percent of the main dashboard to deep dive views.

            We hypothesized that five of seven potential customers would install our closed beta and give us three feedback sessions. This tested whether customers would be willing to "pay" for beta access and worked as a leading indicator of adoption. The first five signed up.

            In one of our beta feedback sessions, a customer kept repeating the phrase, "This is golden". A few weeks before, his team started hearing complaints from developers that they couldn't push their apps onto the platform.

            What nobody knew at the time was that the platform had run out of memory. That resulted in days of frustration that would not have occurred if they had our product—the team would have been alerted to low memory long before running out.
