          We weren’t more than two weeks into interviewing when a clear pattern emerged: When customers upgraded the platform, their monitoring dashboards broke. That’s because when Pivotal’s component teams released new versions, they would change metric endpoints without documenting the changes.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">

          The essence of the user experience goes something like this: When there is a potential issue with Cloud Foundry, our users go on a journey through an constellation of alerts, dashboards, and Slack conversations. They pick up bits of information from one source, make a decision, then go on to another to get the next thing they are looking for, all-the-while continuously updating their mental model of the overall system.

          On Cloud Foundry, a down VM might be reason to panic. Or it might not mean anything. It can depend on a lot of factors. What else is going on? Is there an update to the system in progress? If that’s the case, it’s normal for certain VMs to go down temporarily. On the other hand, some VMs are mission-critical, but only under certain circumstances. There is no one thing or easy answer.

          The first panel above was our initial attempt at a router health design. It did not go over well.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Operators want to first understand how much traffic is flowing through the routers and whether 
          there are any trends up or down. If there is a potential problem, operators would want to know
          if there is a change in the number of errors, which tend to have a steady-state rate at scale. After that,
          CPU usage becomes relevant.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Our sketches and wireframes took these insights into account, and we eventually got to the final design, on the right.

          After they told us their story, we read through the metrics we were considering including in the dashboard to make sure everyone understood them. Then we went to a whiteboard and sketched together.

          “When did the system first start to have problems?” is one of the first things operators want to know. The alert that complelled them into action might have been triggered long after the root of the problem started. We made timestamps as precise as possible.

          The design evolved as we got feedback. We added a new stoplight, debated hierachy and streamlined the look and feel. (Last panel by Justin Roozeboom)

          The design was not just UI work. We also defined the underlying logic.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          In order to define the stoplight logic, we had to take a number of things into account:
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">A failed test isn’t necessarily an emergency</div>
          Cloud Foundry is self-correcting. A failed test might be the result of an upgrade or some other temporary cause. The trick is you want to show a red stop light when there is a real problem and not a false alarm. 
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Tests are interdependent</div>
          For example, if the “start app” test fails, you can’t see if it is emitting logs because the app doen’t exist.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Several tests run concurrently</div> 
          HealthWatch runs three test simutaneously. We had to interpret sequential failures versus concurent failures. We were concerned that since random test failures (one or two per hour) might be over represented with concurency.

          This got us to declutter and move about 25 percent of the main dashboard to deep dive views.

          I went on use a similar practice on several other projects. A lot of things worked. By meet regularly, the panel felt they were part of the process. We developed a repore, which meant we got comforatable getting critical feedback. In addition, the field engineers on the panel were, in the end, basically SMEs (subject matter experts). They trained other field engineers.

          The design we came up with was not top-down. It emerged over several weeks. This was good in a lot of ways, but had some drawbacks. IA was challenging. We  made design decisions optimized locally and when stepped back, getting everything to sync was difficult.
