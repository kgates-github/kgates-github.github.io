          In the beginning, it was just a product manager and me. Senior management had tasked us with coming up with an out-of-the-box data dashboard for monitoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry, an operating system for cloud platforms like Amazon’s AWS.

          Neither of us thought it was a viable concept. At least on the surface. During an early stakeholder interview, a marketing director let us know that our product was a "fool’s errand”.

          We weren’t more than a week into interviewing when we realized there was an urgent problem: When customers upgraded the platform, their monitoring dashboards broke.

          In our situaltion, it was almost impossible to thoroughly understand metrics and all their implications up front. We needed to just get ideas out of our heads and into the world quickly and start learning.

          The first design above on the left was our initial attempt at a router health design. It did not go over well.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          We quickly learned what we got wrong: We focused too much on router CPU and tried to force everything into 
          a stoplight visualization.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Operators want to first understand how much traffic is flowing through the routers and whether 
          there are any trends up or down. They then want to get an idea of how responsive requests are.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          So we went back to the drawingboard. (Literally.)

        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          Our next sketches took these insights into account. The throughput chart at top went over well, as did the CPU usage at the bottom. The middle charts tried to show distributions of latency and CPU, but generally confused everyone.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          Next we learned that if there is a change in throughput, operators would want to know if there is a change in the number of errors, which tend to have a steady-state rate at scale. We added a chart showing errors at thee bottom. We still clung to trying to show CPU as a distribution, but it did not pass muster.

          For data dashboards, like in typography, meaning drives layout. Dashboards are in some ways like logographic hieroglyphs&mdash;meaning is often created by combining together multiple symbols, or graphs, in a logical order. 
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-0">
          Through our iterative design process, we first understood the implications of metrics and how they naturally hung together with others. That drove layout decisions. For example, some indicators, like HTTP throughput, are key to interpreting others, and therefore are given prominence.

          The design was not just UI work. We also layed out the underlying logic. In order to define how the stoplights work, we had to take a number of things into account:

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">A failed test isn’t necessarily an emergency</div>
          Cloud Foundry is self-correcting. A failed test might be the result of an upgrade or some other temporary cause. The trick is you want to show a red stop light when there is a real problem and not a false alarm.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Tests are interdependent</div>
          For example, if the “start app” test fails, you can’t see if it is emitting logs because the app doesn’t exist.

          <div class="bold-5">Several tests run concurrently</div> 
          HealthWatch runs three test simultaneously. We had to interpret sequential failures versus concurrent failures. We were concerned that since random test failures (one or two per hour) might be over represented with concurrency.

          Some things can only be learned through functioning code. HealthWatch would need to help operators

        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Pivotal’s cloud operations team in Ireland agreed to be the first to use HealthWatch in a production environment. That team hosted a SaaS product called Pivotal Tracker, an agile project management tool  which has several hundred-thousand active users.
