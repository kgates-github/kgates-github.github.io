          We weren’t more than a week into interviewing when we realized there was an urgent problem: When customers upgraded the platform, their monitoring dashboards broke.

          <div class="bold-5 pb-4">Metrics are “esoteric”</div>
          For the uninitiated, it is difficult to know what to do with the platform’s metrics and they can be hard to interpret. Customers “want a decoder ring” to help them.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5 pb-4">Data overkill</div>
          There are "thousands of metrics” and “customers don’t know what to monitor”. Only a relatively small number of metrics are really needed to be effective, the trick is to know which ones.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5 pb-4">3rd-party tools are prevalant</div>
          Most customers are already paying for licenses for third-party tools and plan to use them for platform monitoring. But a “bridge” solution could be useful while they are getting up to speed with the platform.

          To solve the problem of needing domain knowledge, we made platform monitoring experts part of design. To do this, we reached out through our networks and found coworkers with deep knowledge of platform monitoring. The idea was to create a panel of experts and have them fully embedded in the design process.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Failure is good. What's important in design is learning, not being right. Rapid prototyping means being wrong constantly until you gain confidence that you aren't. 
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          In our situaltion, it was almost impossible to thoroughly understand metrics and all their implications up front. We needed to just get ideas out of our heads and into the world quickly and start learning.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-0">
          Here's an example of how rapid prototyping worked with continuous feedback from the expert advisory panel:

          The first design above on the left was our initial attempt at a router health design. It did not go over well.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          We quickly learned what we got wrong: We focused too much on router CPU and tried to force everything into 
          a stoplight visualization.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Operators want to first understand how much traffic is flowing through the routers and whether 
          there are any trends up or down. They then want to get an idea of how responsive requests are. 
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          So we went back to the drawingboard. (Literally.)

        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          Our next sketches took these insights into account. The throughput chart at top went over well, as did the CPU usage at the bottom. The middle charts tried to show distributions of latency and CPU, but generally confused everyone.

          </div>
        </div> 
        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          Next we learned that if there is a change in throughput, operators would want to know if there is a change in the number of errors, which tend to have a steady-state rate at scale. We added a chart showing errors at thee bottom. We still clung to trying to show CPU as a distribution, but it did not pass muster.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          For data dashboards, like in typography, meaning drives layout. Dashboards are in some ways like hieroglyphs&mdash;meaning is often created by combining several symbols, or graphs, together. 
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-0">
          Through our iterative design process, we first understood the implications of metrics and how they naturally hung together with others. That drove layout decisions. For example, some indicators, like HTTP throughput, are key to interpreting others, and therefore are given prominence.

          The design was not just UI work. We also layed out the underlying logic. In order to define how the stoplights work, we had to take a number of things into account:
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">A failed test isn’t necessarily an emergency</div>
          Cloud Foundry is self-correcting. A failed test might be the result of an upgrade or some other temporary cause. The trick is you want to show a red stop light when there is a real problem and not a false alarm. 
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Tests are interdependent</div>
          For example, if the “start app” test fails, you can’t see if it is emitting logs because the app doesn’t exist.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          <div class="bold-5">Several tests run concurrently</div> 
          HealthWatch runs three test simultaneously. We had to interpret sequential failures versus concurrent failures. We were concerned that since random test failures (one or two per hour) might be over represented with concurrency.

          Bringing HealthWatch to market wasn’t easy. The design process had many ups and downs, but we got through it.

          Measurable Outcomes
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Measurable outcomes in the enterprise world are tricky. Measurable outcomes should be leading indicators that keep everyone honest, but in the enterprise, uptake of products is slow and indicators tend to be lagging &mdash; Pivotal's sales cycles are about 18 months.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          We came up with a leading indicator: Five given customers will install our closed beta and give us three one-hour feedback sessions. This tests whether customers are willing to "pay" for the product. It also builds in customer feedback.

          About one year after our GA (generally available) release, I shared a U.S. patent with the PM and engineering lead.

          <div class="bold-5 pb-4">The expert advisory panel worked well</div> 
          By meet regularly, the panel felt they were part of the process. We developed a repore, which meant we got comfortable getting critical feedback. In addition, the field engineers on the panel were, in the end, basically SMEs (subject matter experts). They trained other field engineers.

          <div class="bold-5 pb-4">Dogfooding had a lot of benefits</div> 
          The feedback was great, but dogfooding also had a marketing angle: We could say, “We use this product ourselves.”

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5 pb-4">Emergent design came with challenges</div>
          The design we came up with was not top-down. It emerged over several weeks. This was good in a lot of ways, but had some drawbacks. IA was challenging. We made design decisions optimized locally and when stepped back, getting everything to sync was difficult.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5 pb-4">We got UCD and Agile to play fairly nice</div>
            A big challenge for me at the time of this project was figuring out how to make UCD work with Agile. Pivotal's R&D department was almost cult-like in it's adherence to Agile processes and UCD was a pretty new concept for most people.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          Our weekly design cadence with regular interaction with engineering worked. A lot of this is due to the fact that our design was emergent. There is still work to be done in figuring our how to sync the oscillating cadence of a UCD process with the relentless momentum of an Agile dev team.
