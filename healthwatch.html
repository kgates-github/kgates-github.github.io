          I worked closely with the PM at first, as I was the sole designer for the first several months. Later on, two designers joined the project on temporary rotations. By enlarge, I worked remotely from San Francisco, while the rest of the team was based in Denver.

          We weren’t more than a week into interviewing when we realized there was an urgent problem: When customers upgraded the platform, their monitoring dashboards broke. That’s because when Pivotal’s component teams released new versions, they would change metric endpoints without documenting the changes.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-0">
          It was painful for our users: Upgrades are the worst possible time to not have insight into the platform’s health.

          On Cloud Foundry, a down VM might be reason to panic. Or it might not mean anything. It can depend on a lot of factors. What else is going on? Is there an update to the system in progress? If that’s the case, it’s normal for certain VMs to go down temporarily. On the other hand, some VMs are mission-critical, but only under certain circumstances. There is no one thing or easy answer.

          I probed the panel by asking, "What about this don't you like?" We quickly learned what we got wrong: We focused too much on router CPU and tried to force everything into a stoplight visualization. We didn't include overall traffic.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">A failed test isn’t necessarily an emergency</div>
          Cloud Foundry is self-correcting. A failed test might be the result of an upgrade or some other temporary cause. The trick is you want to show a red stop light when there is a real problem and not a false alarm.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Tests are interdependent</div>

          <div class="bold-5">Several tests run concurrently</div> 
          HealthWatch runs three test simultaneously. We had to interpret sequential failures versus concurrent failures. We were concerned that since random test failures (one or two per hour) might be over represented with concurrency.

          HealthWatch would need to help operations teams 
          navigate through unexpected disruptions, the nature of which can't be predicted. That meant we needed to test under real-world circumstances with real data.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-5">
          Pivotal’s cloud operations team in Ireland agreed to be the first to use HealthWatch in a production environment. That team hosted a SaaS product called Pivotal Tracker, an agile project management tool  which has several hundred-thousand active users.

          We conducted weekly check-in sessions. In these sessions, members of the operations teams walked us through scenarios where they used HealthWatch. We got a lot of usability feedback, but also validated that the app helped them get through unexpected problems, such as failed upgrades.

          Once the operations team had been using HealthWatch for several weeks, we gave operations team members workbooks in Google Draw that contained movable metrics panels. We then asked them to arrange the dashboard the way they would like it.
