          Our mandate was to explore customer problems around developer tools access, understand what the most important problems are, and come up with a product. Entering an open-ended, ambiguous problem space like this can be daunting. There are few things that can help:
        </div>

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
	        <div class="bold-5">Data</div>
	        We surrounded ourselves with data. The journey map and key slides from our research deck were up on all the walls around us.
	      </div>
	      <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
					Conversations anchored around data tend to be fruitful. Establishing that everyone needs to back their assertions with facts helps teammates avoid taking stances. Taking stances can lead to interpersonal conflicts and undermine collaboration.

	      <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
	        <div class="bold-5">Feedback</div>

	      <div class="regular-lg pb-0">
	        <div class="bold-5">Team health checks</div>
					I ran quick daily health checks to get a sense if anything was not okay and needed attention. Assessing team health regularly can help reduce festering problems and interpersonal conflict. People also get comfortable talking about things that might not be going as well as planned.

          We decided to first focus on offering developer-created tools (a.k.a., APIs) through a marketplace-like experience. This was part of our solution to enable independently-managed tools, which had risen to the top during our ideation week.

          Enterprises manage tens of thousands of APIs. It’s painful and challenging. We started there. It’s a tough problem space. Our customer can have up to 80,000 APIs. These APIs are a tangled mess of overlapping functionality and varying levels of quality. On top of that, there are established competitors.
