					Shortly after I arrived in Pivotal’s London office, I met with the director of product, who posed a challenge: She wanted me to discover the top problems enterprise engineers have in getting the tools they need and anchor a product team around them. 
				</p>
				<p class="regular-md pb-2">
					It was a big challenge. I was in London to hire and build out a design team, which meant I was the only designer in town, at least for a while.

  			<h4>My Role</h4>
	    	<p class="regular-md pb-2">	
					As design lead, I drove the research and synthesis over a period of several weeks. After that, I facilitated a week-long ideation workshop and design sprint.
				</p>
				<h4>Collaborators</h4>
				<p class="regular-md pb-2">
					For the research, I paired with an engineer (and aspiring designer) on a daily basis for a couple months. I also facilitated various design workshops that included engineers, PMs, stakeholders, marketing, and others.

					<li><p class="regular-lg"><b>Clarity in thinking:</b> Articulating concepts clearly means thinking clearly. Thinking clearly requires practice. We built that practice into the design process.

					<li><p class="regular-lg"><b>Countering group-think:</b> I sometimes worry that ideation workshops can create a group-think bubble. Constantly exposing what we were doing to people outside our immediate sphere brought scrutiny to everything we did.

The presenter explained there is no substitute for seeing how skis actually perform in different conditions like powder and groomed runs. Might the user “test drive” APIs? </div>

			<div class='mt-0 mb-2'>The most up-voted idea was a search field that prompts the user to conplete the sentence, "I have..." In this case, a passport ID. Once that is entered, the next field "I need..." is auto populated with possible results. This resonated with the engineers, who pointed out this is exactly how you think when looking for an API.</div>
