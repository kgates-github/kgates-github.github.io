          The first panel above was our initial attempt at a router health design. It did not go over well. 
          One of the panel members said, "I dont' like anything about this."

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          We quickly learned what we got wrong: We focused too much on router CPU and tried to force everything into 
          a stoplight visualization.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Operators want to first understand how much traffic is flowing through the routers and whether 
          there are any trends up or down. They then want to get an idea of how responsive requests are. If there is a potential problem, operators would want to know
          if there is a change in the number of errors, which tend to have a steady-state rate at scale. Only after that,
          CPU usage becomes relevant.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          Our sketches and wireframes took these insights into account, and we eventually got to the final design, on the right.

          Here is an example of how we used co-creation to inform designs: First, we had a Cloud Foundry operator walk us through a time when they had to troubleshoot a problem with their system.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          After they told us their story, we read through the metrics we were considering including in the dashboard to make sure everyone understood them. Then we went to a whiteboard and sketched together.

          The idea was to co-design the dashboard the operator wished they had. We recorded the sessions and annotated photos of the white board. We then used them as a guide when we got back to our desks. The real value was not in the drawings, but in the conversations we had at the whiteboard.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">The question “When?” is paramount </div>
          “When did the system first start to have problems?” is one of the first things operators want to know. The alert that complelled them into action might have been triggered long after the root of the problem started. We made timestamps as precise as possible.

        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Component IDs and timestamps are keys</div>
          Operators bounce between our app and others, such as log search tools. Component IDs and timestamps are the two things you need when jumping between systems. We add copy-to-clipboard buttons to everything we could.

          On Fridays, I presented wireframes and sharpie sketches to the panel. Sometimes we got things right straight away; sometimes we were wrong and needed a lot of iterations.

          In order to define the stoplight logic, we had to take a number of things into account:
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">A failed test isn’t necessarily an emergency</div>
          Cloud Foundry is self-correcting. A failed test might be the result of an upgrade or some other temporary cause. The trick is you want to show a red stop light when there is a real problem and not a false alarm. 
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Tests are interdependent</div>
          For example, if the “start app” test fails, you can’t see if it is emitting logs because the app doen’t exist.
        </div>
        <div class="regular-lg pb-4">
          <div class="bold-5">Several tests run concurrently</div> 
          HealthWatch runs three test simutaneously. We had to interpret sequential failures versus concurent failures. We were concerned that since random test failures (one or two per hour) might be over represented with concurency.
