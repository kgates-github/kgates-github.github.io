					Our customers are Fortune-500 companies who each employ thousands of engineers, all of whom need a diverse set of tools, such as databases and APIs to do their jobs. Getting access to these tools is rife with bottlenecks, red tape and shadow IT.

  			<h4>Challenge</h4>
	    	<p class="regular-md pb-2">
					Shortly after I arrived in Pivotal’s London office, I met with the director of product, who posed a challenge: She wanted me to discover the top problems enterprise engineers have in getting the tools they need and anchor a product team around them. 
				</p>
				<p class="regular-md pb-2">
					It was a big challenge. I was in London to hire and build out a design team, which meant I was the only designer in town, at least for a while. 
  			</p>
  		</div>
  		<div class="col-md">
  			<h4>My Role</h4>
	    	<p class="regular-md pb-2">	
					As design lead, I drove the research and synthesis over a period of several weeks. After that, I facilitated a week-long ideation workshop and design sprint.
				</p>
				<h4>Collaborators</h4>
				<p class="regular-md pb-2">
					For the research, I paired with an engineer (and aspiring designer) on a daily basis for a couple months. I also facilitated various design workshops that included engineers, PMs, stakeholders, marketing, and others.
