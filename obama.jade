      div.margin-top-sm.columned 
        p From research conducted at the campaign's Chicago headquarters, we knew that many voters respond favorably to talking points about Obama's first term, but only when it's about their own community. 

        p Created for the Obama 2012 campaign, Project Atlas is an app that makes Obama's accomplishments engaging and relevant to voters at a local level. The application does this by detecting user location and offering county-level information about improvements to health care, taxes, clean energy, and more.

      div.margin-top-sm Based in the San Francisco Technology Field Office, I led the ideation, wireframing and ran weekly presentations to campaign headquarters. In addition, I led the dev team, coordinated the efforts of more than a dozen volunteers, and wrote a good portion of the JavaScript and CSS.

      div.margin-top-sm 
      | The campaign provided us with several data sets they us to use. With the research findings in mind, I set out to get a better understanding of what stories might be found in the data. Ultimately, my goal was to come up with ideas to pitch to our stakeholders. 
      div.margin-top-sm I set up a geospatial database, and started making maps. I made a lot: children gaining health care; renewable energy investments; tax savings, and many more.

      div.margin-top-sm Our stakeholders liked the direction of a recovery-themed map I created, which used data about the 2009 stimulus bill. The first wireframes showed stimulus projects color-coded by category. These categories corresponded to the campaign's core policy areas: education, energy, health and infrastructure. Since most of the data was uncategorized, we mobilized volunteers to label about 2,000 projects.

    div.margin-top-sm Everything could have easily ended at this point. Rather than give up, I went back and re-evaluated the data sets we hadn't used, and came up with a new solution. It detected the user's location and displayed the president's accomplishments across all of the campaign's policy areas. The digital director at headquarters liked the new direction, and gave us the green light.
