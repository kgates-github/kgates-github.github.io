              This project started as a challenge posed by Pivotal's director of product for its London R&D org. She wanted me to do two things:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Discover the top problems engineers in large enterprises have in getting the tools they need to build software.</li>
              <li>Organize a product team anchored around those problems and come up with solutions.</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>
              It was a big ask, but also a big opportunity.

              On Thursday, we took our top ideas and wrote scenarios describing a future in which our customers are enjoying the value of our not-yet-existent products. We were envisioning presenting a storyboard to the advisory panel on Friday and wanted our ideas to be approachable and expressive.

            In short, our solution ideas were not solid enough technically for our engineers. For a lot of types of projects, safe assumptions can be made about the tech. That was not the case for us.

            We went back to the whiteboard and discussed. The solution was to group ideas into product concepts. Those allowed the engineers to envision the "how" to a level that was acceptable.

            Our research deck got a lot of attention. I presented it several times as part of our integration process. At several points there were dozens of people in the Google doc, including vice presidents. One PM told me she had been referring to the deck on a regular basis. In addition, I later used the research findings to inform two other related projects.

            <li><b>If something is not working, nip it in the bud and pivot:</b> Our initial scenario-based presentation didn't gel. We took the outcome we were after and came up with a solution that worked.</li> 
            <li><b>High-trust between team members enables efficiency:</b> High trust enables critical feedback, which was necessary for us to recover from mistakes.</li>
            <li><b>Transdisciplinary ideation is powerful:</b> We gained insights that only came about because designers, engineers and field engineers were working together on the same problem. Marketing team members on our advisory panel had feedback that the rest of us would not have thought of.</li>
            <li><b>Storyboards are great tools for conveying vision:</b> I got feedback that people had no idea of what we were up to until they saw the storyboard. In large organizations, I've found people will hear about your project, assume worst-case scenario, and imagine conflict that doesn't exist. A good vision storyboard can dispell mistrust and open doors for collaboration.</li>
