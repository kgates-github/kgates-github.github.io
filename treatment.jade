      div.margin-top-sm
        p Treatment flow diagrams help doctors and analysts understand how patients progress through therapeutic regimens. They are typically static, and can remain unchanged for decades. (See example below.)
        p Rx Treatment Flow is a prototype designed to demonstrate how a longitudinal view of diabetes treatments, generated entirely with patient data, could be explored using interactive data visualization.

      div.subhead-01-bold PROTOTYPE
      div.margin-top-sm 
        p We started with a question: How do patients get to a particular drug? With that in mind, we worked backwards. The data analysts started with a set of all patients on Invokana, a late-stage diabetes drug, then found out what drugs these patients had switched from. They then repeated the process for those drugs. The result was a chain of treatments going back in time, each new branch representing a patient group with it own set of characteristics.

      p The base of the prototype is a tree traversal. Each node on a branch is a drug regimen. Clicking on a node opens a new branch revealing what drugs patients were on before that. The parent nodes work as a cognitive frame to shape understanding of the information that's being revealed (e.g., you are not looking at a random set of drug regimens, but those given to diabetics who eventually switch to Metformin).

      p I decided to give up fidelity in favor of offering a high-level view. Enough information is offered to keep users oriented without bogging them down with too much data. Details would be revealed when the user wants them.
